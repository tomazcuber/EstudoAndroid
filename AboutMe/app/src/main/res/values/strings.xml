    <string name="bio">I am a brazilian Software Developer that works mostly with embedded systems,
        but as of right now I\'m learning Kotlin and Android development with a focus
        on Smart Payment Terminals (or Smart POS devices).
        \nBesides payment applications, I\'m interested in
        developing games, AR/VR applications, IOT and
        embedded machine learning solutions.
        \nThe latter is the focus of my graduation thesis for my
        Bachelor\`s degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,
        which I\'m currently developing as I write this app.
        \nIf you found this app or source code and would like to get in touch,
        feel free to send an e-mail my way at tomazcuber@outlook.com :)
